## Requirements
- This code is written for `python3.10`.
- Follow the installation instructions of the VMamba project to install the [RS-Mamba(rsm-ss)](https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_Remote_Sensing_Mamba)  environment.
- pytorch = 2.1.1
- torchvision
- selective-scan-0.0.2
- pytorch_wavelets
- numpy, prettytable, tqdm, scikit-learn, matplotlib, argparse, h5py, timm, einops
- [https://blog.csdn.net/yyywxk/article/details/136071016](https://blog.csdn.net/yyywxk/article/details/140422758)

## Dataset

### Fine-grained land-use classification dataset

####  GID-15 dataset

- Dataset Download: [GID-15 dataset](https://captain-whu.github.io/HPS-Net/).

#### FUSU Dataset

- Dataset Download: [FUSU Dataset](https://github.com/yuanshuai0914/FUSU).

## Training and Evaluating
The pipeline for training with CLFDA is the following:

1. "option.py"
- `args.dataset = 'gid15'`
- `args.arch = 'CLFDA'`

2. Train and Evaluate the model. For example, to run an experiment for the GID-15 and FUSU dataset,  run:

- `python main.py`
